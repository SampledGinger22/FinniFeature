## Pre-development scoping (seeded from the scoping conversation)

The brief was deliberately vague — per the founder, to test the ability to assess an
ambiguous spec and iterate. The following decisions were made during a structured scoping
pass that resolved conflicts in the original brief and narrowed scope to what is actually
graded (UI/UX and code quality for patient management).

### Scope
- **D1 — Hero feature is compound filtering.** The founder's example query ("intake
  patients in New York under 30") is the rubric. The product is organized around making it
  effortless. Billing, sales pipeline, and appointment-as-requirement were explicitly
  removed by the founder and are documented as next-iteration work, not built.
- **D2 — Scoped wide, then deliberately narrowed.** Comprehensive architecture and docs are
  retained (this is a foundation to iterate on), but the *built* v1 UI is focused on the
  patient-CRM hero plus a "Your day" view. Cut features are listed, not silently dropped —
  the narrowing is the product-thinking signal.
- **D3 — "Your day" view kept in v1.** It carries the care-for-providers thesis. It leans on
  patient status (no appointment data exists yet); calendar-backed scheduling is logged as
  the next step.

### Architecture
- **D4 — Backend as Vercel serverless functions, not Express.** The deploy target is Vercel;
  a long-running Express server fights it. Thin handlers over a service/repository layer
  keep the OOP structure without the server. Docker is local-dev parity only.
- **D5 — Vercel Postgres + Drizzle + Zod.** Free tier, serverless-friendly, idiomatic
  Drizzle; Zod validates the API boundary with types inferred from schemas.
- **D6 — State split:** TanStack Query (server data) / Zustand (global UI) / useState (local).
  TanStack Query delivers the "rapid refresh on edit" requirement; React alone is not a
  state manager.
- **D7 — No auth.** Opens to the dashboard. Therefore preferences persist to localStorage
  (no server-side user to hang them on).
- **D8 — Monorepo (Turborepo + Bun) with a shared `@finni/shared` package** as the single
  source of truth for types, enums, Zod schemas, and DateTimeUtil.

### Domain
- **D9 — Six-status lifecycle.** Shipped the founder's four (inquiry, onboarding, active,
  churned) verbatim and added **waitlisted** and **paused** as informed domain extensions —
  real ABA practice states the vague spec omitted (endemic waitlists; routine pauses).
  Recorded as a deliberate iteration on the spec.
- **D10 — Normalized model:** `patient` → many `address`, many `contact_method`. Chosen over
  denormalization despite the headline query needing a join, because it is the correct
  foundation; the join is covered by deliberate indexing (D12).
- **D11 — UUID v7 primary keys**, app-generated. Time-ordered (index-friendly at scale),
  non-enumerable (no count leakage).
- **D12 — Composite index `(deleted_at, archived, status)`** for the default list query;
  `address.region`/`city` and `patient.date_of_birth` indexed for the location/age filters.
  Every index documented with its reason.
- **D13 — Age is derived, never stored** (`DateTimeUtil.calculateAge`), so card and filter
  never disagree at a date boundary.
- **D14 — Lifecycle states:** `archived` is a boolean (reversible UI-visibility, no timer);
  `deleted_at` is a nullable timestamp (soft delete, 30-day purge). Trade-off noted: if an
  archive-by-date sort is later needed, add `archived_at` then.
- **D15 — Required at creation:** first_name, last_name, dob, ≥1 email, ≥1 address with
  state. Enforced by one shared Zod schema for both form and API. Creation is one atomic
  transaction.
- **D16 — `has_insurance` boolean** with a small card indicator. A display flag, explicitly
  *not* a coverage/billing model (scope boundary).
- **D17 — Contact methods limited to email/phone for v1**; fax/other deferred as a
  schema-safe addition.

### Conventions
- **D18 — `@/` path alias, no `../` traversal; no import aliasing; globally unique names;
  named exports; no `any`; no magic numbers in styles; comments ≤2 lines (what+why).** All
  enforced by lint and/or hooks so they cannot drift.
- **D19 — Enums use the const-object union pattern, not native `enum`** (no runtime JS
  bloat, no unsafe numeric members, no Zod/Drizzle boundary shims).
- **D20 — dayjs centralized in `DateTimeUtil`.** All stored time UTC; rendered in user zone
  (settings → else browser default); DOB is zoneless.

### Design
- **D21 — Palette derived from Finni's real brand variables** (primary `#ed762f`, surface
  `#fbf7f0`, slate `#34415b`, plus their natural supporting hues), adapted for management-app
  density (smaller radii, restrained saturation, neutrals carry surface area).
- **D22 — Primary button is orange with dark ink text.** White-on-orange fails WCAG AA
  (2.90); orange-with-ink passes and keeps Finni's signature color as the hero action.
- **D23 — Six status colors as an intentional progression**, all passing AA, shown against
  both the default and eye-strain palettes.
- **D24 — Retired the skeuomorphic theme** (gradients, inset/text shadows) from the brief's
  `bootstrapTheme.ts` in favor of Finni's clean rounded feel. The mechanism
  (antd-style `createStyles` + `ConfigProvider`) is kept; the aesthetic is replaced.
- **D25 — WCAG 2.1 AA target; per-widget error boundaries + skeleton/empty states**
  promoted to hard requirements.
- **D26 — Avatars:** generated-face seeds + deterministic colored-silhouette fallback, with
  a single `USE_HEADSHOTS` flag to force all to fallback.
- **D27 — Finni's real logo used** (provided by the builder, on-brand for their demo) via a
  `BrandLogo` atom with a neutral fallback.

### Compliance & observability
- **D28 — HIPAA-*aware*, not certified.** Field-level PHI encryption (repository layer),
  encryption at rest, no PHI in logs or client storage, soft delete, audit-log scaffolding.
- **D29 — Winston with PHI redaction** + per-handler request timing. No metrics stack
  (deferred). Frontend: reporting error boundaries + redacting client logger behind a
  Sentry-ready seam. No RUM/analytics/session-replay (session replay is a PHI liability).

### Tooling
- **D30 — `.claude/` agents, skills, hooks committed to the repo** so enforcement travels
  with the code and applies to every contributor. See `03-agent-skill-hook-proposal.md`.
- **D31 — C6 (`no-magic-numbers`/hex/px) is lint-enforced on style-convention files only**
  (`**/*.styles.{ts,tsx}`, `**/theme/**`). "A style" is not AST-detectable globally without
  false positives; since styling is centralized (C9), raw values may live only in those
  files, so scoping the lint there enforces C6 everywhere it legitimately applies. Broader
  enforcement (e.g. all `.tsx`) was rejected as too noisy; the `convention-reviewer` agent
  (A1) backstops inline cases. See spec §4.
- **D32 — Commit directly to `main` for this solo demo; commit messages stand in for PRs**
  so a repository reviewer reads the rationale inline. The H2 dangerous-op guard's
  main-commit block is therefore dropped (its force-push / secrets / DROP / dayjs-Date
  guards remain). Trade-off: no PR-gated review step; acceptable for a single-builder demo,
  revisit if the project gains contributors.

### Build process
- **D33 — React pinned to 18.3, not 19.** First-class antd v5 support without the
  React-19 compatibility patch package; revisit when antd lands (Step 3) if 19 is wanted.
- **D34 — `@finni/shared` exports TypeScript source** (no build step); consumers (Vite,
  Vitest, Vercel/esbuild) transpile it and `tsc` resolves it via package `exports`. Avoids
  cross-package build ordering. `vite` is pinned to v6 via an `overrides` entry because
  `vitest@2` otherwise pulls a second `vite@5`, clashing plugin types under
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`. *(Superseded in part by D37 — see below.)*

### Step 1 — Shared package
- **D35 — TS entity shapes are camelCase; DB columns are snake_case.** The repository/Drizzle
  layer maps between them. camelCase is the TS idiom; snake_case is the SQL idiom. Documented
  so the boundary mapping is expected, not a surprise.
- **D36 — `@typescript-eslint/no-redeclare` is scope-disabled in `**/enums/**`.** The §6.4
  const-object union pattern deliberately pairs a value and a type of the same name, which the
  rule false-flags. The exception is the narrowest possible (enum files only); `tsc` still
  catches genuine illegal redeclaration there, and `no-shadow` + the A1 convention-reviewer
  still backstop C4's global-uniqueness intent everywhere. Resolves the §6.4-vs-C4 collision.
- **D37 — `@finni/shared` is built (`tsc` + `tsc-alias`) to `dist`; consumers import the
  build.** Supersedes D34's no-build decision. A source-exported package cannot expose its
  internal `@/` alias to consumers (each consumer's tsc/Vite resolves `@/` against its own
  `src`). Building rewrites `@/` to relative paths in `dist`, so the package keeps the `@/`
  convention and its subdirectory structure while remaining consumable by tsc, Vite, and
  Vercel. Turbo's `^build` dependency orders the build before dependents' type-check/dev.
  The D34 `vite` override still stands. Trade-off: shared must be built before web dev/check
  (handled by turbo); acceptable for a scalable foundation.
- **D38 — Creation defaults and validation (Zod, §6.5).** New patients default to
  `status = Inquiry`, `country = US`, `hasInsurance = false`, address `type = Home`, contact
  `label = Mobile`, `is_primary = false`. Email contacts are email-validated; phone contacts
  require ≥7 digits; DOB must be a real, non-future `YYYY-MM-DD`. Age uses dayjs year-diff,
  so a Feb-29 birthday ages on **Feb 28** in non-leap years (dayjs clamps `+1yr` to Feb 28) —
  a defined, documented convention rather than an accident.

### Step 2 — Compliance vs. queryability
- **D39 — PHI encryption split so the hero filter stays exact at scale (Option A).** Resolves
  the collision between §11 field-level encryption and the §1 hero filter (age + location).
  - **Field-level encrypted** (AES-256-GCM, per-value random IV, authenticated; encrypt-on-
    write / decrypt-on-read in the *repository layer only*): `first_name`, `middle_name`,
    `last_name`, `contact_method.value`, `address.line1`, `address.line2`, `address.postal_code`.
    These are high-identifiability free-text PHI and are never filter/sort targets, so
    encrypting them costs nothing on the hero path.
  - **Queryable** (stored as normal indexed columns, protected by DB encryption-at-rest +
    scoped repository queries + the no-PHI-in-logs rule): `date_of_birth`, `address.region`,
    `address.city`. These power exact age range + sort and the location filter; a B-tree index
    on encrypted bytes is impossible, so they must remain queryable.
  - **Why this holds at scale (not a 50-row illusion):** filters/sorts hit B-tree indexes on
    unencrypted columns — same query plan at 50 or 500k rows. Decryption cost scales with the
    *paginated page returned*, not table size (O(page)). Rejected the decrypt-in-repository
    alternative precisely because it is O(n) full-scan.
  - **Bounded deviation:** §11 literally said "encrypt DOB"; we keep DOB queryable instead,
    because field-encrypting it breaks the headline exact-age filter *and* sort. This is the
    single, documented concession. Posture for identified PHI = at-rest encryption + access
    scoping + audit + minimum-necessary, with field-level encryption as defense-in-depth on
    the highest-risk free-text.
  - **Deferred:** searching patients *by name* would need a blind/HMAC index (deterministic
    lookup over encrypted names); out of scope for v1's status/location/age hero filter.
- **D40 — Data-layer tooling.** `postgres.js` as the single Postgres driver (works for local
  Docker and Neon over TCP from Vercel Node functions, avoiding a second edge driver);
  `drizzle-kit` for migrations (committed under `apps/api/drizzle/`); `uuidv7` for app-side v7
  PKs (Node's `randomUUID` is v4 only); `@faker-js/faker` for the deterministic seed; and
  `@electric-sql/pglite` for repository tests — a real Postgres engine in-process, so scope +
  encryption behavior is *exercised* without requiring Docker in CI. Repositories take an
  injected `AppDatabase`, so the same code runs against postgres.js and pglite.
- **D41 — Docker kept as the standard local-dev DB, hardened.** Docker stays (D4: dev parity,
  never the deploy path) because a local Postgres matching prod's engine is the standard,
  self-contained, offline-capable local setup. Hardened after a collision: explicit Compose
  project name `finni` (no longer adopts other projects) and host port **5434** (5432/5433 were
  taken on the dev machine) → container 5432, matched in `.env.example`. Tests use pglite; dev
  can alternatively point `DATABASE_URL` at Neon.
